    <h3>Business Impacts</h3> <br />
    <p>
        Airline data<sup><a href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/27818/hf_ar-2008-055.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
        shows that around 50 per cent of engine-related flight delays and cancellations are due to
        maintenance errors, costing the airline around USD $140,000 for a flight cancellation, and
        an average of USD $17,000 per hour for delays. In many cases, it was found that the causes of
        maintenance errors<sup><a href="https://www.casa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net351/f/_assets/main/lib100215/hf-engineers-res.pdf" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
        were procedural errors (e.g. errors made in a sequence of actions as opposed to proficiency
        errors due to lack of skills, experience and practice.)

        <h2>Pilots</h2>

        <br />

        <p>
            A pilot is training in a flight simulator and during a highly stressful exercise, misses several cues that
            could have led to a serious failure. Using SenseS's real-time display of cognitive load alongside a recorded
            video of the session, the pilot can identify how they may have prioritised certain tasks while neglected
            others and develop strategies to counteract any 'tunnel vision' effect adopted during the flight.

        <h2>Drivers</h2>

        <br />

        <p>
            A learner driver is preparing for their provisional license practical exam and is using SenseS to identify
            their performance during stressful situations on the road. After recording their drive, the user can
            determine what maneuvers required the most cognitive effort and what events on the road caused them to make
            dangerous decisions.

        <h2>Heavy Machinery Operators</h2>

        <br />

        <p>
            An heavy machinery operator is performing a training exercise with their adviser monitoring their
            actions and recording the session with SenseS. At several points during the exercise, the operator
            experiences a high cognitive load and makes several errors that could have led to costly damage to the
            equipment. However, in the training environment and accompanied by SenseS, the adviser can use the recording
            and cognitive load display to convey to operator what tasks caused them to react in this way so they can
            improve their response.
