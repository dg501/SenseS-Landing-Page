    <h2>An overview of SenseS</h2> <br />

    <div id="overviewShift">
        <div>
            <p>People under high cognitive load are at risk of taking mental shortcuts,
                which can lead to poor decisions being made
                (tunnel vision effect,  cognitive bias in behavioural economics).
                SenseS combines ThoughtWorks' capabilities in IoT, Agile Analytics
                and Experience Design to  explore ways of helping people make better
                decisions by monitoring their cognitive load.</p>
            <br />

            <p>The primary goal of SenseS is to make workers aware of their
                cognitive load whilst in a safe educational setting such as a simulation
                exercise or a training program. All data recorded will be visualised as a
                training log which workers can then refer to in order to understand their
                personal mental load capacity. As a result, workers undergoing training will
                be more aware of the cognitive bias effect and hence take the right actions
                (e.g delay decisions,  seek someone else's perspective etc.)</p>

    <h2>Technology Used</h2>

    <br />

    <div id="techShift">
        <div>
            <img src="../Drawables/cat1.jpg" height="250" width="250" alt="technology.jpg"/>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>SenseS uses a wearable sensor to record GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) and
                correlate these values to levels of mental stress. An app is being developed
                to pair with the device via Bluetooth and provide simultaneous video of the
                subject wearing the device. The recorded video and stress levels can then be reviewed
                in real-time together to locate periods of high stress relating to an increase in cognitive load.</p>
            <br />

            <p>From here, the user can assess ways of improving their performance in these situations and
                visually identify actions/decisions that were influenced by their stress levels.
                The hope is that people who operate under high cognitive load such as pilots, surgeons
                and heavy machinery operators, can use SenseS as a training and educational tool to make their
                workplaces safer and more efficient.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>

    <br />

    <div id="userTestingShift">
        <div>
            <p>Through testing, it has been determined that the task load responses will be recorded using
                signals collected from the Shimmer Galvanic Skin Response and Optical Pulse Sensor on the
                wrist and fingers. Data will be streamed real-time to a Windows machine, with the outputs
                saved as CSV. The full collection period will be recorded so that participants can review their tasks
                and make annotations; in particular indicating their self-rating of the load experienced
                at each of the transitions.</p>

            <br />

            <p>There has been a lot of testing, and through doing this SenseS has provided a suitable
                platform for those in high-stress environments undergoing periods of high mental stress
                to enable operators to review their actions and level of mental load, and reflect on them.</p>

            <p>A snapshot of the original team that worked on the SenseS
                project. These ThoughtWorkers are determined to project
                and capture the idea of SenseS in the eyes of interested
                parties, and are actively seeking to find those with
                similar interests.</p>
